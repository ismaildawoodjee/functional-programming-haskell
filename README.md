# Functional Programming in Haskell

Excellent [set of lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA_-EWSPTJcu4i7RFCl_KeGrrz37C4_Oc) from RWTH Aachen University on Functional Programming in Haskell. Unfortunately, the [lecture notes](https://verify.rwth-aachen.de/fp21/) are in German, so I have been slowly trying to translate them into English for me (and for anyone else) to study from them.
